**This repository contains the expressions necessary to prepare an address points shapefile for conflation in OSM.**

You will need the newest version of QGIS (1.9 or higher) and ArcMap 10.1 to perform these operations.

You can download the latest version of QGIS here: http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

First prepare your address points .shp file by following the steps in **Processing Address Points.md**, then convert it to a .osm file by following the steps in **ogr2osm.md**.
